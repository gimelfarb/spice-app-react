# context-selectors

This example is a modified version of the Intro example (<https://github.com/gimelfarb/spice-app-react-intro>). Using the more advanced `Spice.Context` and `Spice.Attach` React components, which allow hooking into existing DOM (defined in `index.html`) using CSS selectors.

Noteable features:

- Use `Spice.Attach` to hook into elements using CSS selectors
- TODO: Use `Spice.Original` component to reference original content of an element
